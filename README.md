# Mood To Do List 


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Glitch


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Krishna Krishnakumar - Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science
- Member 2: Nandana Rajeev - Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science


### Project Descriptions 
Mood-Driven Task Manager: A fun to-do list app that not only tracks your tasks but predicts moods—even for non-living things!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most task managers are boring and lack personality. They only track tasks but don’t add any fun or humor. Our project “solves” this nonexistent problem by predicting moods for tasks—even non-living things—making everyday task management a bit more entertaining and surprising!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We added mood predictions not just for your tasks, but also for your non-living stuff—because why should only people have feelings? Whether it’s your coffee mug feeling empty or your laptop overheating, our app makes task management weirdly fun and totally unnecessary—in the best way possible!
